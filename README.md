Applying CSS and HTML knowledge to build a [google homepage](https://web.archive.org/web/20191130234759if_/https://www.google.com/ "Reference for the page") clone.

Practicing the following know-hows/skills through this project:
- planning an html and css layout of a webpage with a predefined design
- using flexbox in css
- applying basic accessability principles
- debugging with dev tools in the browser
- using css reset files

Difficulties I ran into, while doing this project (stuff I'll need to practice more of):
- placing elements with flexbox
- dividing the nav bar into two parts, finding out that "float" apparently doesn't work with flexbox
- making the navs responsive and stacking them well
- placing icons inside of the search bar container
